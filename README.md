# pysweeper
A text-based minesweeper, made in Python 3. If you already have Python, just run it through the terminal and play. I've tried to make the code as simple and readable as possible.

Thanks to [@A-KouZ1](https://github.com/A-KouZ1) for suggesting this to me.

## Features:
- Automatically open surrounding tiles if the tile has 0 bombs around it
- Custom size (but no more than 10x10 or it wouldn't look very good) and number of bombs, although you still have to insert the number into the code manually
- Mark tiles for bombs. Mark is removable
- "Are you sure" prompt if you try to open a marked tile
- Error-checking for the prompt
- 80% bug-free?
